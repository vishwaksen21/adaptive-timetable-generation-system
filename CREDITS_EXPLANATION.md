## Why 11 Empty Slots?

The 11 free periods are **intentional and correct** because:

1. **VTU requires 22 credits** = 31 contact hours (not 42)
2. Free periods are used for:
   - Library hours
   - Self-study
   - Assignment work
   - Project work
   - Remedial classes (if needed)
   - Faculty consultation hours

## Credits Calculation Formula

- **Theory subjects**: 1 credit = 1 hour/week
- **Lab subjects**: 1 credit = 2 hours/week (practical work)
- **Project work**: 2 credits = 2 hours/week (guided work)
- **Audit courses**: 0 credits but mandatory attendance

## Timetable Features

✅ No teacher names displayed (as requested)
✅ Empty slots clearly marked as "FREE"
✅ Lab sessions in continuous 2-hour blocks
✅ Parallel batches for labs (A1/A2/A3, B1/B2/B3)
✅ Fixed activities on designated days
✅ Proper breaks (Short break + Lunch break)

## Sample Weekly Schedule

**Total Instruction**: 31 periods
**Free Periods**: 11 periods (for flexibility)
**Breaks**: Included (not counted in 42)

This follows VTU's credit-based semester scheme perfectly!
